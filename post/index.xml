      <description>The mutual influence of the fields of computer science and psychology is undeniable. Psychologists have adapted computer science theories to describe psychological phenomena, computer scientists have returned the compliment, and both fields are combining their strengths to work towards advancing understanding of important topics such as human brain function and treatment of psychological disorders. Each field is enriched by the other, a scientific symbiosis pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.</description>

      <description>This year I was lucky enough to be one of the attendees of Neurohackademy, a two-week workshop focused on reproducible and shareable neuroscience. The first week of this workshop featured a dazzling array of speakers from a variety of research backgrounds, including psychology, computer science, and biomedical engineering, who led demonstrations on data science tools and methods. The second week was spent putting these tools to use in groups, hacking on different projects that were then shared with everyone on the last day of the workshop.</description>
