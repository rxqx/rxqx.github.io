					<div class="entry-content">
						<p> The mutual influence of the fields of computer science and psychology is undeniable. Psychologists have adapted <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01216/full" target="null">computer science theories to describe psychological phenomena</a>, computer scientists have <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414" target="null">returned the compliment</a>, and both fields are combining their strengths to work towards advancing understanding of important topics such as <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/7/1601.long" target="null">human brain function</a> and <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045037" target="null">treatment of psychological disorders</a>. Each field is enriched by the other, a scientific symbiosis pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
<br><br>
Recently <a href="sanlab.uoregon.edu" target="null">The Social and Affective Neuroscience lab at the University of Oregon</a>, under the direction of Dr. Elliot Berkman, was influenced by computer science to undergo an organizational re-structuring. For the 2017 academic year, the lab adopted a framework used in software development called "Scrum" in order to increase productivity and efficiency. Since it is the start of a new school year for many people, I wanted to write up my experience working in this new lab framework as it might spark inspiration for other psychologists trying to make the most out of AY'18.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="neuronbanner.jpg" alt="Banner image"></p>
<h2 class="section-title"><span>What is Scrum?</span></h2>
<p>Time for a firehose of jargon: Scrum is an Agile development framework system that encourages the iterative collaboration between developers and product owners during a series of sprints to ensure efficiency, quality, and promptness of deliverables.
<br><br>
Put simply: it is an organizational structure for the purpose of product release and update that highlights the values of collaboration and efficiency in core roles and components. 'Agile' is the parent philosophy for software development while Scrum is one of its many styles of practical implementation. Agile was introduced to the world with its own manifesto, and you can <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="null">gaze into the abyss here</a>.
<br><br>
As written in the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html" target="null">Scrum Guide</a>, the organizing pillars of the Scrum system of Agile development are <b>transparency</b>, <b>inspection</b>, and <b>adaptation</b>.
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li><h5>Transparency</h5>All members of a team share a common understanding regarding product development. Transparency about what commitments are required, what timeframes are reasonable for product scopes, and what a finished product looks like are all critical components of Scrum. Team members are also expected to be transparent in assigning tasks and reporting on progress.</li>
  <li><h5>Inspection</h5>Inspection of product development is an ongoing process in Scrum. Team members regularly reflect on and report the factors contributing to or detracting from development goals.</li>
  <li><h5>Adaptation</h5>Regular inspection of the development process provides opportunity for adaptation to unaticipated challenges before they become intractable issues. This pillar reflects the value that the Agile philosophy places on responding to behavioral experience and welcoming necessary change.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>These pillars are supported by the three core roles in a Scrum Team. <b>The development team</b> is a self-organized unit of all the members working on development of a product to a specific goal. <b>The product owner</b> is a single person with vested interest in the outcome of a product, who provides top-down direction for development goals. Finally, <b>the Scrum Master</b> is an individual who takes on a meta-role for the Scrum Team. They ensure transparency, monitor introspection, and introduce options for adaptation. Their primary goal is not just completion of a product, but also success for the Scrum Team in terms of collaboration and work experience.
<br><br>
The primary implementational tool in Scrum is the <b>Sprint</b>, a pre-determined timeframe within which Team Members are expected to complete specified goals. In order to keep the Sprint goals within sight, Sprints should last no longer than 30 days. At the beginning of the Sprint, teams meet to discuss goals, responsibilities, and potential barriers. During the Sprint, team members engage in regular introspection and adaptation. At the end of the Sprint, team members convene for further introspection, a review of goal progress, and a demonstration of any completed goals. The entire process is typically managed through software specifically developed for Scrum implementation, such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="null">Jira</a>, which permits the tracking and analysis of productivity. These statistics in turn can be informative for adaptation and improving the efficiency of the Scrum team.
<br><br>
That's the very condensed summary the Scrum framework, which is itself widely used in software and product development. But if you are a fellow research scientist you may at this point be asking how this could possibly map on to a research lab. Well...
</p>

<p><h2 class="section-title"><span>Scrum for research labs?</span></h2>
<p> There appears to be a similar format to the organizational structure of psychology research labs, at least in my experience. The process of writing papers is organized such that the lab PI has control over the big picture of the paper, a postdoc or senior graduate student maintains more control over the specific analyses/direction of the paper, and less senior students or research assistants handle the nitty-gritty of collecting data and churning out descriptive statistics. If any scripts are needed for a specific part of the research pipeline, the latter group might spend time writing fresh scripts or haphazardly adapting existing ones written by graduate students long gone. The only official time that the research team has to discuss progress to others is during weekly lab meetings, and even then, it is more likely that the work is already almost finished. Feedback and comments at these meetings are often scattershot and without time planned for followup, often not useful. Outside of that, the research team might have a standing weekly meeting without explicit agendas except &ldquo;progress&rdquo; or &ldquo;work through issue we&rsquo;ve been stuck on for a month&rdquo;. Additionally, graduate students might have one-on-one weekly meetings with their PI where they are told that they are not doing enough on a project or taking on too many projects.
<br><br>
The common results of this format? Atomized workers in the same lab. Redundancy of effort. Lack of shared knowledge. Unclear expectations for roles and responsibilities. Attendence at meetings driven by cultural inertia rather than interest or a shared goal. Unclear or ignored deadlines. <b>Wasted time!</b> <b>Demotivation!</b> These were the primary reasons why the SAN lab decided to try something different and switch to Scrum. We were aiming for these specific goals as a result of our switch:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>All meetings should have a practical purpose.</li>
<li>All lab knowledge should be shared.</li>
<li>Project progress should be transparent for everyone in the lab, not just the research team.</li>
<li>Training for job skills should be incorporated into decisions about distributing work.</li>
<li>Lab culture should be supportive, receptive, and adaptive. Lab culture should help buffer against burnout.</li></ul>
</p>
<p> Scrum seemed like a good fit for these goals, but there was one remaining question: what could research labs consider a &lsquo;product&rsquo;? Manuscripts might be what initially comes to mind, but we found this lacking. Manuscripts take a long, long time from initial conception to publication- sometimes years- and even though we anticipated increasing efficiency using Scrum, the length of time until &lsquo;done&rsquo; could still pose a challenge for maintaining motivation. Instead, we went with a definition that I hope will be widely use in psychology (and especially in hiring committes for academic jobs). Our &ldquo;products&rdquo; would include pieces of writing, tools, stimuli, or datasets. For example, writing a script to <a href="https://github.com/kdestasio/bidsQC" target="null">convert and quality check imaging data</a> is a product, as is developing a food image stimuli set to use in different <a href="https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/files/2018/03/Cosme-2018-Choosing-to-regulate-does-choice-enhance-craving-regulation-1z1z4dd.pdf" target="null">lab studies</a>.
<br><br>
Using this definition of &lsquo;product&rsquo; allows us to break larger, long-term goals (manuscripts) into smaller, short-term accessible ones, thereby increasing our rate of experienced successes and allowing us to play to our relative strengths and desires on a research team.
<br><br>
With that settled, we began the 2017 academic year as a (perhaps the first?) Scrum psychology lab.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align:center;background-color:black;color:white;font-family:serif;font-size:175%;"><i>&ldquo;Wasted time! Demotivation! These were the primary reasons why we decided to switch to Scrum.&rdquo;</i></blockquote></p>

<p><h2 class="section-title"><span>How we implemented Scrum</span></h2>
<h3>Scrum Team</h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have Scrum without a Scrum Master, and who better than the person who introduced the lab to this framework in the first place, our own <a href="https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/people/may/" target="null">Dr. Lisa May</a>? She was the north star guiding our ship out of the churning waters of endless pointless meetings and work isolation to the calm smooth seas of Scrum collaboration. The Development Team consisted of the lab PI, graduate students, and full-time research assistants, which means that we were all inherently granted equivalent control over product development. We opted not to enact a Product Owner, as this position is reserved for someone outside of the Scrum Team&rsquo;s organization that nonetheless has a say in the development of a product (so, for example, a representative for a company that a software development team is creating a product for).</p>
<h3>Sprints</h3>
<p>We defined our Sprints as two-week blocks of time, beginning on Mondays and ending on Fridays. Importantly, this was the only restriction on work time that was enforced, meaning that team members could plan their work according to their own schedules within a Sprint. This flexibility was good news for me when my insomnia kicked in during the winter term and I could work until 2 in the morning and sleep until noon, as long as my goals were achieved by the end of week 2.</p>
<h3>New meeting format</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the meat of the change: being intentional in the restructuring of our meetings to achieve our stated goals. We changed our meetings in both format and content.
<h5>Planning meetings (75 minutes | Full Scrum Team)</h5>
<p>Occurred on the first day of every new Sprint. Each research project in the lab is alloted a slot of time. The Scrum Master then helps members of the Development Team working on that particular project to set realistic Sprint goals; this includes team members making explicit plans for the division of labor to reach these goals. As part of our introspection and adaptation progress, we discovered that it was helpful be transparent about time constraints external to the lab on team members, so that we could collectively adjust our expectations of workloads and goals.</p>
<h5>Stand-ups (15 minutes | Full Scrum Team)</h5>
<p>Stand-ups are held three times a week for the purposes of transparency and introspection. Every member of the team reports a) what they have completed since the last stand-up, b) what they are currently working on, and c) what barriers they have to moving forward. This presents the opportunity for the Scrum Master to note any common issues to adapt to, and for other team members to help each other overcome their barriers. This also ensures full transparency for all research projects in the lab.</p>
<h5>Project meetings (1-2 hours | Development Team)</h5>
<p>Development team members working on a specific research project together may decide to schedule reocurring or single-instance project meetings. These meetings typically take the format of group hacks, where team members work alongside each other to complete a Sprint goal. As we have no Product Owner and all members of the team are afforded equal control over a project&rsquo;s development, this meeting may also serve as an opportunity to discuss project direction.</p>
<h5>Pipelines (2 hours | Development Team)</h5>
<p>Piplines is a unique hackathon-style meeting that we decided as a group to incorporate into our weekly schedule. One focus of the lab is to establish easily reproducible neuroimaging analysis pipelines. Since this is a goal shared across all members of the development team, we use this meeting to work through steps in our neuroimaging analysis pipeline together. </p>
<h5>Demo (1 hour | Scrum Team)</h5>
<p>Scheduled for the last day of a Sprint. Development Team members present demonstrations of what they have accomplished over the past Sprint. Demonstrations over the past year have included walking through a new analysis script, sharing a conference poster, and running through a new experimental task.</p>
<h5>Retro (1 hour | Scrum Team)</h5>
<p>Also occurs on the last day of a Sprint. This retrospective meeting is a built-in time for the entire Scrum Team to reflect on the past Sprint. The Team discusses common challenges and plans ways to adapt to them next Sprint, and celebrates each other&rsquo;s achievements. This meeting is the endcap to the Sprint.</p>
<h5>Support Group (1 hour | Development Team minus lab PI)</h5>
<p>The support group is another unique component of our lab&rsquo;s Scrum framework. It relates to our goal of wanting to estabish a supportive environment and prevent burnout. The support group takes place without the lab PI to give graduate students and full-time research staff a space to discuss personal issues, including those which may relate to grad school or the lab environment. The support group has proven to be intergral to maintaining lab morale and positive relationships.</p>
<hr>
<p>At this point you may be somewhat shocked that I am writing a post in support of a system that requires a maximum of 8 meetings a week. But keep in mind that these meetings are intentionaly structured to <b>reduce redundancy and increase productivity</b>. Rather than spend a couple hours a week in meetings, plus additional solo time working on research projects, we have shifted our working hours into scheduled collaborative meeting times.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="scrumflow.png" alt="Scrum work flow"></p></p>

<p><h2 class="section-title"><span>Was the switch worth it?</span></h2>
<p>In my opinion: Yes!
<br><br>This new system allows us to achieve our lab goals in many ways that the previous organizational structure could not. Lab morale, efficiency of meetings, and individual productivity have all increased. Everyone in the lab has their own unique research project to work on but we spend our time working collaboratively as a true lab unit. And although we have increased the number of meetings we attend, each meeting tackles a specific task that might have gotten short thrifted previously- for example, thinking through research goals and planning incremental steps is given enough time in Planning Meetings to reduce unexpected confusion disrupting the process later. Finally, the opportunity to reflect on our work processes, provide feedback, and adapt to that feedback is an invaluable component to this framework. Not only does it provide opportunity to improve our workflow, it also makes all members of the Scrum Team feel recognized for the unique value that they provide to the group.
<blockquote style="text-align:center;background-color:black;color:white;font-family:serif;font-size:175%;"><i>&ldquo;All members of the team should feel recognized for the unique value that they provide to the group.&rdquo;</i></blockquote>
<p>
The next step for our lab includes incorporating Git and Jupyter notebooks formally into our Scrum framework, in order to further lab transparency and reduce scripting redundancy across studies. Although I&rsquo;ve still got until October before the new academic year starts, I can say with confidence that this next year will be productive and fulfilling.</p></p>

<p><h2 class="section-title"><span>Tips for building your own Scrum lab</span></h2>
<p>If you are now feeling motiviated to build a Scrum framework for your own lab or research groups, I recommend that you read the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html" target="null">Scrum Guide</a> for the complete Scrum vision, from which you can pick and choose what pieces work for you. But there are only two things that, based on my experience, will determine the successful implementation of Scrum (or any Agile framework):
<h5>Establish an environment of mutual respect</h5>
<p>The Scrum Team must respect each other in order to be successful. This means that all team members have a safe environment to express their ideas, concerns, and/or personal constraints within. Not all Scrum labs need a Support Circle (but I encourage you to include one!), but the system will fail if people are over-committing and under-performing because they are afraid to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;. The system will also fail if team members do not feel empowered to bring their introspections about the process to the group. If concerns are not respected, challenges to productivity will go unnoticed and the team cannot adapt and move forward. An environment that is perceived as a respectful space for everyone&rsquo;s viewpoints will innoculate the team against conflict and resentment.</p>
<h5>Take commitments seriously</h5>
<p>Using a Scrum framework correctly requires a lifestyle change. The team members need to be willing to commit 100% to the tasks they take on, and the meetings they attend. Importantly, people should not be forced into doing more work than they can and should feel empowered to communicate their time and work needs (see above). But in order to sustain morale and productivity, team members should take their commitments seriously. This means meeting Sprint goals and fully engaging in meetings (not alt-tabbing on the sly to answer emails or browse twitter). This will probably be the biggest challenge in making a change. But if all team members are committed to making it work, and communicate times when they can&rsquo;t, the potential benefits make a few bumps in the road on the way to change entirely worth it.
<hr></p>

<p><h3>So, is Scrum right for you?</h3>
<p>Establishing a Scrum framework requires an &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; mentality. You have to be willing and able to make big changes, including adding (probably) more standing commitments to your schedule. But if you find yourself feeling as though you spend most of your days in meetings but getting nothing done; frustrated that you waste hours and days writing scripts for your study without knowing that someone already did something similar for theirs; isolated working on a research project without lab collaborators; or lost and overwhelmed in the research process, Scrum is one potential solution for you.</p>
