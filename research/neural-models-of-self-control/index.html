					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Self-control describes the psychological process of inhibiting one’s desire for an immediately available reward in favor of another, longer-term one. It is considered to be core component in successfully encouraging health-promoting behaviors, such as exercising, and avoiding behaviors detrimental to long-term health, such as consuming large amounts of junk food. It is therefore a popular topic of study for those interested in developing interventions to encourage lifelong health and well-being.</p>
<p>It is currently still unclear how brain activity relates to self-control outcomes, although there are many theories about the roles that specific brain areas play during this process. Our research is motivated by this uncertainty. We decided to conduct a research study that would allow us to directly compare neural theories of self-control within a group of people who were making decisions relevant to their long-term health goals.</p>

<p>In our study we compare a <b>dual-process</b> theoretical model of self-control to a <b>value-based choice</b> model. Both models include predictions for the interplay between brain areas belonging to two broad regions. Frontal areas are found in the brain region lying underneath your forehead and your temples. Subcortical areas are in the center region of your brain, underneath layers of tissue- this is the region that cannot be seen from the outside. In our research we are focusing on two frontal brain areas, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and one subcortical area, the ventral striatum (VS), pictured in the below image.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
<p>The <b>dual-process model</b> uses the image of a see-saw to explain the neural process underlying self-control outcomes. In this model, self-control results from the relative balance between activity in logical, “cold,” frontal brain areas opposite emotional, “hot,” subcortical areas. When frontal areas are highly active the subcortical areas are not and self-control is a success; but when frontal areas become taxed and activity decreases, the seesaw tips and subcortical area activity increases, resulting in impulsive behavior (and self-control failure).</p>
<p>In contrast, the <b>value-based choice model</b> proposes that self-control success or failure results from a calculation of subjective utility that one places on the variety of possible outcomes, where the the outcome determined to have the highest subjective value driving behavior. Here, both frontal and subcortical brain areas are thought to be active in response to the options being evaluated, and that the comparative cumulative activity in these areas should in turn predict self-control reults.</p>
<p>We compared these two theoretical models by on their ability to predict the relationship between neural activity and decision-making outcomes of a group of overweight dieters who had the explicit goal to make better eating decisions. These dieters underwent neuroimaging while viewing 30 images of healthy snack foods, such as apples and carrot sticks, and 30 images of unhealthy snack foods, such as ice cream and candy. While viewing these images they were asked to place bids between $0-$2 on each food item, and were told that at the end of the experiment one bid would be randomly chosen; since they would actually receive that snack food in exchange for their placed bid, the best strategy was to bid according to how much they actually wanted to eat the food. Thus, we used the healthiness of the snack food and the bid amount that participants placed to indicate a self-control success or failure.</p>
<p>We then extracted a measure of neural activity during the decision-making tasks from our brain areas of interest, vmPFC, dlPFC, and VS. Next, we included this measure along with participants’ bid amounts and snack food healthiness in a series of statistical models designed to test the relative performance of the dual-process and value-based choice theories. After comparing a variety of statistical models, we felt we had enough evidence to reach a conclusion- our data were more consistent with the value-based choice model of self-control. That is, self-control successes or failures were associated with activity in both frontal <i>and</i> subcortical regions. The dual-process theory would predict that frontal regions would be highly active during the presentation of healthy snacks, as they were health-goal promoting, but not active during the presentation of unhealthy snacks, and expect the opposite pattern for subcortical regions; however, we did not observe this to be the case in our data.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align:center;background-color:black;color:white;font-family:serif;font-size:200%;">
<i>“We found that our data were more consistent with the value-based choice model of self-control.”</i>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first instance of comparing these two neural models of self-control directly. But it is important to note that our evidence neither confirms or denies either of these theories. Rather, our results provide a jumping-off point for future studies that are focused on refining a neural model of self-control. Future research could compare the same two theoretical models in other self-control contexts, or develop new neural models entirely based on the pattern of brain region activity that we observed. And hopefully in the future, these results can be inform the development of holistic interventions to improve health and well-being.</p>
