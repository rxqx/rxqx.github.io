      <description>The Planfulness Scale (Ludwig, Srivastava, &amp;amp; Berkman, 2018) is a 30-item measure that assesses the tendency for people to exhibit patterns of thoughts about goals that have been shown to encourage goal achievement in laboratory research. It weaves together previous work from achievement and personality psychology to provide an easily distributed metric of whether people tend to use evidence-backed goal-encouraging habits.
The original aim of developing this scale was to inform intervention research.</description>
